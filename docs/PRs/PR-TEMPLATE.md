## Summary
One paragraph. What changed, why, user-facing impact.

## Decision Log
Document what was chosen AND what was rejected. Highest-value section for future agents. Duplicate the block below for each distinct decision.

### Decision: [name]
- **Chose:** 
- **Rejected:** [option] because [reason]
- **Rejected:** [option] because [reason]
- **Why this matters later:** 

## Files Touched
Expand each entry from the `files_touched` frontmatter with its role in this change. Frontmatter is authoritative — if this section and the frontmatter list disagree, the frontmatter wins.

- `path/to/file.ts`: one-line role in this change

## Dependencies
Frontmatter `depends_on` and `related_prs` are authoritative for machine parsing. Use this section for prose context the frontmatter can't capture.

- **Builds on:** prior PRs or systems
- **Enables:** what this unlocks downstream
- **Will break if:** upstream changes that would break this

## Testing
- **Tested:** 
- **Coverage gaps:** 
- **Edge cases handled:** 

## Security Impact
Touched any auth, input validation, secrets, CSRF, or RBAC paths? If yes, describe the review done. If no, write `None` with a one-line reason. Security-critical paths flagged in root `CLAUDE.md` must never be weakened silently.

## Known Limitations
Shortcuts or tech debt introduced, with reason.

## Rollback
Concrete steps. Include env vars, DB state, config reverts. Add as many steps as needed.

## Agent Handoff Notes
For the next agent modifying this code without other context.
- If you touch [X], also check [Y]
- [Anything that looks wrong but is intentional, with reason]
- [Non-obvious invariants]

## Pattern Observations
Did anything in this PR feel like a pattern worth spreading, or a contradiction with how the team usually does things? This feeds the self-evolution loop (see `REFLECTION.md`).
- **New pattern seen:** [short name + one-line description, or `None`]
- **Contradicts prior PR:** [`pr_id` + brief note, or `None`]
- **Question/field that felt unhelpful:** [which question or frontmatter field, and why, or `None`]
- **Question/field we wish existed:** [proposed addition, or `None`]
